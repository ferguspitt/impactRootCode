Working on news organizations' impact on Wikipedia

Background:
Wikipedia is probably the most widely accessed repository for public knowledge. As the sixth most-visited website it plays a massive role in informing a vast, diverse range of people. For many casual researchers, it is the only place they'll go to inform themselves about a topic. However, wikipedia has a policy against original research, making it interesting to consider what sources are cited.

The code and files in this repository are resources to examine this question, with a particular interest in 'journalism' organizations (as dynamic a concept as that might be).

Technical Details:
The program language is python. The file called pgm.py is the program.

The .log files record the processes of grouping and flattening URLS.
The .csv files record the output of the program.
